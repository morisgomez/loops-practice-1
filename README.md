Write a program that prints all multiples of 3 that are less than 100.

I decided to use a for loop because the question provided a starting and ending point. We start at 3 because that is the first multiple of 3 and we end at less than 100. Hence, the initialization is int i = 3, and the condition is i < 100. We start at 3 and want to stop looping as soon as i passes 100. The last multiple of 3 before reaching 100 should be 99.
